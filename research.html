                    <h2>Neuropeptide Processing and Neurodegenerative Disease | Ongoing</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am currently a lab technician at the Lindberg Lab at the University of Maryland School of Medicine where we use molecular and biochemical
                        techniques to study proSAAS, a uniquitous yet understudied secratory chaperone protein and neuropeptide. Research has shown proSAAS to be a
                        pro-survival, as well as an anti-aggregate, in neurodegenative disease. Overexpression of proSAAS in the substantia nigra of Parkinson's
                        disease model mice show significant abrogation of motor dysfunction related to the disease.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In an effort to elucidate the mechanisms of these effects, my current project is to charaterize and verify protein-protein interactions involving proSAAS in 
                        the secratory pathway. Additional goals include to characterize the expression of proSAAS in the retina during normal aging and in Alzheimer's disease, since
                        little is understood about its expression, yet visual acuity problems are a common cause of age related decline. Furthermore, projects to understand the
                        proteins role during homeostatic scaling are also underway.

                    <h2>Discovery and Analysis of Novel Bacteriophages | Completed</h2>
                    <p>
                        Through the UMBC Phage Hunters program, students - including myself - were able to learn and perform microbiology assays to isolate and disocover novel bacteriophages.
                        Bacteriophages were isolated from soil samples and characterized using transmission electron microscopy imaging, restriction enzyme digests, and plaque morphology analysis.
                        A number of phages were selected for whole genome sequencing, and student continuing with the program were able to perform bioinformatic analysis to predict protien-encoding
                        genes using a variety of tools.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I discovered "Miek", a novel Actinobacteriophage infection S. Scabiei. We were fortunate to be selected for sequencing, and subsequent genome annotation showed it was a Lytic
                        phage. I presented the results of isolation and the novel bioinforamtic analysis at two poster sessions hosted at UMBC.

                    <p>
                        Miek's entry, including the results of sequencing and annotation, can be found <a href="https://phagesdb.org/phages/Miek/">here</a>, or in the repository within my Github page
                        linked below. These findings, as well as those I contributed to for other phages, are currently in review for publication.
